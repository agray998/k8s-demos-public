# LFS458 1.29.1 Lab 8.5 rewrite
## Exercise 8.5: Using StorageClass to Dynamically provision a volume

StorageClasses in Kubernetes simplify and automate the process of provisioning and managing storage resources, provide users with the flexibility to choose appropriate storage types for their workloads, and help administrators enforce policies and manage storage infrastructure more effectively. StorageClasses enables dynamic provisioning of storage resources.
Without StorageClasses, administrators have to manually create PersistentVolumes (PVs) for each PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) made by users. With StorageClasses, this process is automated. When a user creates a PVC and specifies a StorageClass, the system automatically creates a corresponding PV that meets the requirements.

1. Begin by listing to see if we have any storage classes defined on our cluster.

```bash
kubectl get sc
```

```
No resources found
```

2. We dont have any StorageClasses created. Before we can create the sc, we need to deploy a provisioner. Kubernetes doesn’t include an internal NFS provisioner. We need to use an external provisioner to create a StorageClass for NFS.
Let us deploy using a helm chart.

```bash
helm repo add nfs-subdir-external-provisioner \
  https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/
```

```
"nfs-subdir-external-provisioner" has been added to your repositories
```

```bash
helm install nfs-subdir-external-provisioner \
  nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner \
  --set nfs.server=k8scp \
  --set nfs.path=/opt/sfw/
```

```
NAME: nfs-subdir-external-provisioner
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Jan 8 12:11:39 2024
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```

3. The installation also created a StorageClass for us.

```bash
kubectl get sc
```

```
NAME       PROVISIONER    RECLAIMPOLICY    VOLUMEBINDINGMODE ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION AGE
nfs-client cluster.local/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner Delete Immediate true 12m
```

4. List to see if there are any PV and PVC available. Clean up in previous lab should have removed all of them.

```bash
kubectl get pv,pvc
```

```
No resources found
```

5. Create a YAML file for the new pvc.

```
vim pvc-sc.yaml
```

pvc-sc.yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-one
spec:
  storageClassName: nfs-client
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 200Mi
```

6. Create and verify that when the new pvc is created, a dynamic volume is provisioned.

```bash
kubectl create -f pvc-sc.yaml
```

```
persistentvolumeclaim/pvc-one created
```

```bash
kubectl get pv,pvc
```

```
NAME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES RECLAIM POLICY STATUS CLAIM STORAGECLASS REASON AGE
persistentvolume/pvc-71149612-33f1-4b18-916d-c67f79aca797 200Mi RWX Delete Bound default/pvc-one nfs-client 28s
NAME STATUS VOLUME CAPACITY ACCESS MODES STORAGECLASS AGE
persistentvolumeclaim/pvc-one Bound pvc-71149612-33f1-4b18-916d-c67f79aca797 200Mi RWX nfs-client 28s
```

7. Create a new pod to use the pvc.

```bash
vim pod-sc.yaml
```

pod-sc.yaml:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-server
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: nginx
      name: web-container
      volumeMounts:
      - name: nfs-volume
        mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: nfs-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-one
```

8. Create the pod using the file.

```bash
kubectl create -f pod-sc.yaml
```

```
pod/web-server created
```

9. Get the IP address of the new pod.

```bash
kubectl get pod -o wide
```

```
NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE     NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nfs-subdir-external-provisioner-86bcbb46d7-jwxvl   1/1     Running   0          76m   192.168.1.27    worker   <none>           <none>
web-server                                         1/1     Running   0          74m   192.168.1.193   worker   <none>           <none>

10. Curl the pod’s IP address. We'll get a `403 Forbidden` because there is no index.html file

```bash
curl 192.168.1.93
```

```
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.25.4</center>
</body>
</html>
```

11. Create a new index file in the nfs location.
```bash
echo "Welcome to the demo of storage class" > /opt/sfw/default-<Tab>/index.html
```

12. Curl the pod again. It will now work.

```bash
curl 192.168.1.93
```

```
Welcome to the demo of storage class
```

13. Cleanup by deleting the pod and the claim.

```bash
kubectl delete pod/web-server pvc/pvc-one
```

```
pod "web-server" deleted
persistentvolumeclaim "pvc-one" deleted
```
